# Expense Management Platform

## Overview
The Expense Management project is a full-stack web application designed to help users efficiently track their expenses. Users can create, view, edit, and delete expenses with real-time updates, ensuring that any changes are instantly reflected across all reports. 

This project provides hands-on experience with implementing user authentication, managing documents, and ensuring real-time collaboration using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration system.
- **Expense Management**: Add, update, delete, and view expenses.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Ensures immediate synchronization across reports.
- **Dynamic Reports**: View categorized and detailed expense reports.
- **Intuitive UI**: User-friendly interface built with React.js.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js (Hooks, Context API)
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB (Mongoose for schema modeling)
- **Real-Time Updates**: WebSockets / Firebase (if applicable)
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Token) for secure login
